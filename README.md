# WitcheryCommand
An addon for Witchery that adds a command to change a player's vampire/werewolf level.

Command: `/wcmd <vampire/werewolf> <level 1-10> [Player]`

Things to know:
- If no player is specified, it will set the level of the player who sent the command.
- If you specify a player, you must be in the same world/dimension as them. 
- The command sender must be opped.
